 The workout page gives you access to all current workouts saved by the 
Apollo community. From the main page you can click on a workout and see the body parts it works, and also the equipment required for the workout. Also if you see something wrong feel free to update the workout to your own version view the live update button. 

Apollo is still in its early version and I include to add many new features to it such as, HERO mode which will give you access to workouts performed by Hollywood super hero actors like Thor, Wolverine.
